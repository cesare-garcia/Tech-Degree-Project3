# Tech-Degree-Project3
 My third techdegree project

This project focuses on adding interactivity to form submission on a web page. 

I ensured that the cursor automatically starts on the name field when the page is loaded.

I hid/displayed the 'Other' Job Role Input Text Field depending on whether the option was selected in the dropdown menu or not. 

I disabled the Color element until a theme was selected. The only colors displayed for a theme in the dropdown menu were those that corresponded to it.

I programmed the activities section so that it would keep a running tally of the cost of the different activities that could be selected. 

I set Credit Card as the default pay option. I also programmed the project to only show the fields that corresponded to the payment option selected in the dropdown menu.

I prevented submission of the project if invalid information was provided in the different input text fields. 

I made the web page more accessible by allowing people to see which field they were in if they needed to use the tab button to move from one field to another. I also programmed the project so that very clear messages would be displayed in the fields that had invalid information.
